# Todo

- [ ] Tidy documentation
- [ ] Tidy codebase generally to follow best practice

## Text Editor

- [ ] Load in the rich text data into the text editor to edit the content of a json file

## Forms

- [ ] Form state for editing a page to be held in context
- [ ] Consider alternative approaches for the forms updating the JSON data
- [ ] Add some nicely styled accessible form components to the repo

## Refactoring

- [ ] Add a generic page wrapper component in the pages directory.
- [ ] Refactor to support automatic generation of folders and folder index pages via `[[...slug]]`
- [ ] Carefully go through the page type definitions and add all the nuanced types to getStaticProps and getStaticPaths
- [ ] Replace the scss modules with plain BEM scss?
- [ ] The navigation links in the header could load from the site settings - we should load in the repository name on GitHub and append this to the URL when not developing locally.

## Storybook

- [ ] Add the settings context to the header and footer stories
- [ ] Add a footer story, in the future
- [ ] Get rid of storybook entirely / ignore it for now, no way of deploying it alongside Next.js

## Design

- [ ] Get designs
